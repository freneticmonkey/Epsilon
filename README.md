Epsilon Engine
==============

This is a basic 3D engine written in Python which is currently built on top of Pyglet/PyGame.  It's in a pretty rough state at present and is under heavy development.  This is very much a project in learning about the construction of a 3D engine and is only being developed in my spare time for fun.

Current Features
----------------
- OpenGL 3.3 Renderer using PyOpenGL
- XML Scene loading using custom format
- Wavefront model loading
- Clunky procedural planet rendering.

Future Development
------------------
I've got a rough guide for the features that I want to add to the engine which is currently very fluid so I'll update this as I go.
